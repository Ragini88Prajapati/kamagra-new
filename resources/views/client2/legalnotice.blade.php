  <h2>Liability for content</h2>
  <div>
    As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with Section 7 Paragraph 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). However, according to Sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this respect is only possible from the point at which we become aware of a specific legal infringement. Upon becoming aware of such legal infringements, we will remove this content immediately.
  </div>

  <h2>Liability for links</h2>
  <div>
    Our website contains links to external websites of third parties, over whose content we have no control. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for their content. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time the links were created. Illegal content was not identified at the time the links were created. However, continuous monitoring of the content of linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon notification of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
