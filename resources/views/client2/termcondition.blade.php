 <ol>
    <li> Our services</li>
        <p>KamagraOriginal.to is both an informative website and an online service for consumers. KamagraOriginal.to itself does not offer any
             products. Its service consists of arranging fast, secure, and discreet delivery of genuine products through a trusted and certified 
             pharmacy. Therefore, KamagraOriginal.to is not an online pharmacy, but rather an online service provider for consumers. The website
              offers information on various health-related topics, including (medicinal) treatments and products. These products are not offered 
              by KamagraOriginal.to. KamagraOriginal.to's service is limited to enabling customers to request treatments (and any related products)
               online. The prices quoted correspond to the costs of the products delivered by an independent pharmacy on behalf of and at the
                expense and risk of the customer, as well as the costs of arranging and conducting any online consultation with a doctor.
                 If a customer requests specific medication and commissions KamagraOriginal.to to procure it, KamagraOriginal.to will search for a 
                 suitable pharmacy (for example, based on product availability, distance from the customer's residence, and/or product prices). 
                 KamagraOriginal.to has no contracts with pharmacies and is not bound to any particular pharmacy. Therefore, KamagraOriginal.to is 
                 free to choose from any available pharmacy for each customer request. Furthermore, KamagraOriginal.to does not receive any commission
                  payments from pharmacies. Conversely, KamagraOriginal.to does not make any commission payments to pharmacies, and pharmacies are free 
                  to accept or decline KamagraOriginal.to's customers. KamagraOriginal.to's service is thus a (communication) service that involves the 
                  referral of pharmacies on behalf of, at the expense of, and at the risk of the customer. KamagraOriginal.to acts on behalf of, at the
                   expense of, and at the risk of the customer, as an intermediary between pharmacies and the customer for the sale and delivery of specific products. KamagraOriginal.to is aware of the prices charged by the respective pharmacies in advance, and these prices are not negotiated on behalf of customers or pharmacies. The prices charged by the pharmacies, 
            including shipping costs, are included in the prices listed on KamagraOriginal.to for the service provided by KamagraOriginal.to.</p>

            <p>
                If a customer requests treatment with prescription medication and KamagraOriginal.to is instructed by the customer to obtain this medication, KamagraOriginal.to will search for a suitable doctor (for example, based on availability). KamagraOriginal.to has no contracts with doctors and is not bound to any specific doctors. Therefore, KamagraOriginal.to is free to choose from any available doctor for each customer request. Furthermore, KamagraOriginal.to does not receive any commission payments from doctors. Conversely, KamagraOriginal.to does not pay any commission to doctors, and doctors are also free to accept or decline KamagraOriginal.to's clients. Doctors receive standard compensation per consultation from KamagraOriginal.to (approximately equivalent to the compensation paid by Dutch health insurance companies for online consultations and by Dutch doctors). This compensation is included in the prices listed on the website for the services provided by KamagraOriginal.to. Although KamagraOriginal.to forwards the customer's request to a doctor on the customer's behalf, KamagraOriginal.to has no influence on the course of the actual online consultation with the doctor. The treating physician is completely independent and is in no way influenced by KamagraOriginal.to to prescribe specific medications.

        </p>
        <p>
            All medical questionnaires are prepared by physicians with the utmost care and in accordance with medical-ethical guidelines. It is not possible to complete a medical questionnaire and receive a medical consultation and/or products without prior registration on our website. A secure electronic patient record is created for each user who registers on the website. Professional codes of conduct and legal restrictions may limit the maximum permissible quantity and delivery frequency of products. For this reason, there is no obligation to deliver quantities exceeding these limits, 
            and you will only be invoiced for the products delivered. We reserve the right to refuse orders.
        </p>
        <p>
            Accepting orders is at our sole discretion and that of doctors and pharmacies, and we reserve the right to refuse orders without giving a reason. Additional legal regulations or rules to ensure your safety may apply to certain products. These will be published on the website where applicable.
        </p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Consultations are only available to you if you honestly and truthfully complete all questionnaires available on the website.
	</li>
	<li>
		You are obliged to provide all relevant information to the best of your knowledge and belief.
	</li>
	<li>

	<li>

	</li>
</ul>

<p>We cannot and will not accept liability for damages resulting from:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your patient file, the questionnaires you have completed, or other information you have provided to us contains incomplete, untruthful, or incorrect information, and you have failed to update it regularly;</li>
    <li>You have disregarded advice given on the website or have not passed on information shared on the website to your regular healthcare provider;</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<p>
    You hereby acknowledge that the advice provided on this website is not a substitute for professional medical advice. You are obligated to inform your regular health insurance provider about the recommended treatment and prescribed medications.

</p>

<p>
    All information on this website is available in the languages ​​displayed. It is your responsibility to ensure you understand the questions in the questionnaires available on the website. Contact your regular benefits provider if you do not understand a question, are unsure how to answer it, or do not fully understand the advice or information provided on the website.

</p>

<p>
    When a prescribed product is delivered, it is your responsibility to check that the delivered products are indeed those prescribed by your doctor and are undamaged in any way. If in doubt, contact the delivering pharmacy for advice or request a replacement product (if necessary). Do not use any products that were not prescribed to you or that were damaged during transport.

</p>

<p>Read the package leaflet and all label instructions carefully before use. If you are ordering products for later use, please ensure that the expiry date has not passed before use.

</p>
<p>Make sure that no one other than you has access to the products prescribed to you.</p>

<h2>Contractual relationships between the parties</h2>

<p>
    The sale and delivery of products is based on an agreement between the customer and the pharmacy, regardless of which party collects the invoice amount. Any existing terms and conditions of the pharmacy govern (if applicable) the contractual relationship between the pharmacy and the customer (provided such a business relationship can be assumed). If necessary, these terms and conditions will be made available to the customer by the pharmacy during the ordering process.

</p>
<p>
    KamagraOriginal.to arranges the consultation and acts in its own name and for its own benefit.
</p>
<p>
    The services provided during a consultation are exclusively provided by doctors and are primarily 
    aimed at protecting, maintaining or restoring the health of the person concerned.
</p>
<p>
    Although the consultation is arranged by KamagraOriginal.to, the respective doctor bears full responsibility for the services provided during the consultation. 
    Arranging the consultation is therefore a purely administrative act.
</p>
<p>
    These terms and conditions apply to all services and/or products provided as a result of visiting the website and/or interacting 
    with any of the pharmacies affiliated with KamagraOriginal.to. Pharmacies and doctors are bound by these terms and conditions.
     However, depending on applicable national law, this may mean that the pharmacies and doctors affiliated with us are bound by 
     professional codes of conduct or legal regulations, and the provision of consultation services or the delivery of products may be 
     subject, in part, to the regulations and laws applicable at the locations of the pharmacies, drugstores, and doctors. For example, 
     deliveries of products by a pharmacy located in the UK are subject to UK law. These deliveries are considered to be made from the UK 
     and are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the UK courts. All deliveries of products by pharmacies located in other European 
     countries are subject to the law of the country in which the respective 
    pharmacy is located, are considered to be made from that country, and are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of that country.
</p>
<p>
    Eg, delivery of Products by a Pharmacy in Germany is governed by German Law and will be deemed to have taken place in Germany and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of German courts.

</p>

<h2>
    Medical consultation services
</h2>
<p>
    If a doctor, based on their medical assessment, concludes that the desired treatment is suitable for you, they will issue you a prescription, which will be sent to a pharmacy.

</p>
<p>
    To enable the doctor to determine whether the products you have ordered can be safely prescribed to you, it is important that you complete the medical questionnaire fully and accurately. Omitting required information could result in you being prescribed products that could harm your health.
     To avoid health risks, you must be sure to list all medications you are currently taking on the questionnaire.
</p>
<p>
    If you are unable to complete the questionnaire in full, you agree to refrain from ordering the desired product. In this case, please consult your regular doctor to determine whether there is a contraindication due to any medications or combinations of medications you are currently taking or using,
     or whether using the product could pose any health risks due to your medical history.
</p>
<p>
    Products can have side effects. You should therefore be aware that using a product may adversely affect your health and lead to the side effects listed in the package insert, among others.
</p>
<p>
    You are obligated to inform your regular doctor or pharmacist that you are taking the ordered product. We also point out that neither doctors, nurses, nor hospital staff can
     guarantee that the product you have ordered – even if prescribed – will produce the desired result.
</p>

<h2>Price changes</h2>

<p>
    KamagraOriginal.to reserves the right to change the prices of the products offered at any time. 
    The prices valid at the time of order placement remain unchanged until the order process is completed. 
    Should an obviously incorrect price be displayed due to a software error or human error, KamagraOriginal.to reserves the right to
     cancel the order and inform the customer.
We guarantee that the prices applicable to consultations and products are clearly stated on our website. There are no hidden fees.
</p>

<h2>Changes to product offerings / Changes to information</h2>

<p>
    Since KamagraOriginal.to itself does not offer or deliver any products, KamagraOriginal.to reserves the right, provided no order has yet been placed and registered, to adjust the availability information from suppliers on its website and to remove products before an order has been placed and registered.
     KamagraOriginal.to always strives to keep all texts, photos, and product images accurate and up-to-date.
</p>
<p>
    However, human error cannot be ruled out, so unintentional errors may still occur for which neither we nor the respective supplier can be held liable. The colors displayed on your screen are not binding. You should therefore
     always check before use whether the delivered product corresponds to your order and the product recommended during the consultation.
</p>

<h2>payment</h2>

<p>
    All prices are quoted in euros. All payments must be made by bank transfer or other methods specified on the website. The services offered (including consultations), the party with whom you are entering into a (separate) purchase agreement, and the party collecting the invoice amount will be displayed on the website during the ordering process and are also shown on the order confirmation and invoice. 
    Further information can be found in the section 'General Description of Our Services' in these Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<p>
    If your chosen payment method fails, KamagraOriginal.to, the pharmacy, or the supplier may charge you extrajudicial costs – starting with a flat fee of fifteen (15) euros for administrative costs – without prior notice. Notwithstanding this, KamagraOriginal.to, the pharmacies,
     and/or the suppliers reserve the right to claim reimbursement for any legal collection costs incurred or to be incurred as a result.
</p>
<p>
    By providing payment and billing information, you confirm that you are authorized to use this information and give us or our payment service provider or the payment service provider of the pharmacy or supplier your consent to collect the total invoice amount
     for the items you have ordered, as well as for any associated shipping costs and any other costs due under these terms and conditions.
</p>

<h2>Delivery terms</h2>

<p>
    Orders received are generally released for shipment immediately once the order (for prescription medications) has been approved by the doctor and payment has been received. The stated delivery dates and deadlines are approximate only and depend on product availability and normal processing time. Please note that some products cannot be shipped to all countries.
     Further information can be found on the website. Due to FDA regulations, we do not ship any products to the USA.
</p>
<p>
    Once you agree to the delivery of products, you will enter into a contract with the courier service of your choice. All products are delivered by the supplier within the country where the supplier is based. Shipping is carried out in the name and at the customer's own risk. The customer indemnifies KamagraOriginal.to (as well as the doctors and pharmacies) against all claims that may be brought against the customer for failure to comply with the regulations and import requirements applicable in the respective importing country. You are responsible for paying all customs duties, taxes,
     and charges applicable upon import into your country. You confirm that all ordered products are intended for personal use only.
</p>
<p>
    You hereby appoint the courier service as your representative and authorize them to deliver the products from the supplier's premises. Upon handover of the products to the courier service,
     the supplier's contractual obligations are considered fulfilled, and ownership and risk transfer to you
</p>

<h2>Cancellation and return</h2>

<p>
    Because medications have a limited shelf life and are personalized – as they are prescribed to you individually – and to avoid any risk of product tampering, the suppliers working with KamagraOriginal.to will only accept returns of defective, damaged, or incorrectly delivered products.
     If you receive a defective or damaged product, or if you were sent the wrong product, you can do the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Cancel your order and return the product to the supplier within seven (7) days of receiving the delivery,
         after which you will receive a refund of the purchase price from the supplier within thirty (30) days; or
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask the supplier to exchange the product.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The supplier will reimburse you for the return shipping costs of defective, damaged, or incorrectly delivered products. If any of the above circumstances occur, the supplier is only obligated to take
     the actions described in points 1 and 2. Return instructions and the return address can be found in your order confirmation email.
</p>

<p>
    For over-the-counter products, you have the right to return them within fourteen (14) days of receiving the delivered goods. If you order multiple products at the same time, you can return them within fourteen (14) days of receiving the last product ordered. This right does not apply to prescription products. However, in the case of cancellations, you may be charged for any costs incurred in connection with services already rendered. To cancel an order, request a refund, or if you have questions regarding a damaged or defective product, you can contact KamagraOriginal.to via the contact form on the website. Return shipping costs for undamaged and
     undamaged products are your responsibility. Refunds will be processed within seven (7) business days of approval by KamagraOriginal.to.
