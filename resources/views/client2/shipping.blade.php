  <p>
    Frequently asked questions about shipping and delivery.
  </p>

  <h2>What happens to my order if I'm not at home?</h2>
  <p>
    Most shipments are sent by registered mail. If you are not home, the delivery driver will leave a notification in your mailbox or attempt to contact you by phone. You can track the shipment status using your tracking information in your KamagraOriginal.to account or with your courier. If you were unable to personally receive the package from the courier, please contact them directly to arrange a new delivery date. Otherwise, your package will be returned to the pharmacy after a few days. The courier may charge additional fees if your package needs to be reshipped.
  </p>

  <h2>When can I expect my order to arrive?</h2>
  <p>
    Requests that have been submitted and already processed are forwarded to one of our partner doctors on the same day. The doctor will endeavor to assess your request on the same day as well. Any prescriptions issued can be forwarded immediately to a pharmacy upon request, which will then arrange for the fastest possible delivery. After receiving your payment, delivery of your order is expected to take 1 to 3 business days.
  </p>

  <h2>How will my order be shipped?</h2>
  <p>
    If, at your request, we send your prescription to a mail-order pharmacy, your order will be discreetly packaged and delivered directly to your home. The courier service usually requires a signature upon delivery; however, exceptions are possible. Your order will be shipped in neutral packaging to ensure discretion.
  </p>

    Shipping costs are €5-10 for all orders. All orders over €200 qualify for free shipping.

  <h2>Does KamagraOriginal.to have an EU quality seal for online pharmacies?</h2>

    No, KamagraOriginal.to is not an online pharmacy and therefore does not have an EU quality seal. Our partner pharmacies, however, do have this seal or are eligible for it.
